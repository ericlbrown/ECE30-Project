Register Reference Guide for ECE 30 Spring 18 Lab Project

Purpose:
  1. To label and explain registers as they are used in each function
  2. To use as reference for stack related activities upon revisiting this code
  3. If changes are made said changes will implemented across all code

swap function:

  # a0: base address
  # a1: index 1
  # a2: index 2
  # Swap the elements at the given indices in the list

  $t0: used as a temp variable for finding offsets for addressing array elements
  $t1: used as a temp variable for finding offsets for addressing array elements

  $s0: used solely as temp in swapping
  $s1: used to store value from x[lo] after it is loaded
  $s2: used to store value from x[hi] after it is loaded

Conclusion, we only have to make room on the stack for 3 registers, $sp, and $fp
Move stack 16 units

median of three:

  # a0: base address
  # a1: left
  # a2: right
  # Find the median of the first, last and the middle values of the given list
  # Make this the first element of the list by swapping

  $s0: used to store the number of the index the middle of the set
  $s1: value from x[lo]
  $s2: value from x[hi]
  $s3: value from x[mid]

  $t0: used generally for storing offset to load array index values
  $t1: used in same manner as $t0, we load values from it
  $t2: used for comparison to determine whether to swap values

  So we have a total of 7 registers, $sp, $fp
